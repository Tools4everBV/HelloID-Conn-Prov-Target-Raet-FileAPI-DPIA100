## Introduction

_HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-RAET-FileAPI-DPIA100_ is a _target_ connector for creation of DPIA100 through RAET's _RAET-FileAPI-DPIA100_ API (Beaufort)

This connector contains the DPIA100 target for creating a DPIA100 export for Raet Beaufort to import some generated data from the HelloID provisioning module. This functionality will at one moment be replaced by writing back the desired values by the IAM-API (not supported yet)

This version is created for export only rubriekcode P01035 (emailaddress work)

Please setup the connector following the DPIA100 requirements of the customer. You can choose between an export per day, or a DPIA100 export per person.

## Getting started

### Provisioning PowerShell V2 connector

#### Correlation configuration

The correlation configuration is used to specify which properties will be used to match an existing account within _RAET-FileAPI-DPIA100_ to a person in _HelloID_.

To properly setup the correlation:

1. Open the `Correlation` tab.

2. Specify the following configuration:

   | Setting                   | Value   |
   | ------------------------- | ------- |
   | Enable correlation        | `False` |
   | Person correlation field  | ``      |
   | Account correlation field | ``      |

> [!TIP] > _For more information on correlation, please refer to our correlation [documentation](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/target-systems/powershell-v2-target-systems/correlation.html) pages_.

#### Field mapping

The field mapping can be imported by using the _fieldMapping.json_ file.

### Connection settings

The following settings are required to connect to the API.

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The latest version of this connector requires **new api credentials**. To get these, please follow the [Visma documentation](https://community.visma.com/t5/Kennisbank-Youforce-API/Visma-Developer-portal-een-account-aanmaken-applicatie/ta-p/527059) on how to register the App and grant access to client data.

- [ ] Enabling of the User endpoints.
  - By default, the User endpoints aren't "enabled". This has to be requested at Raet.
- [ ] File processing.
  - When using the Tenant ID and BusinessTypeID (101020), files should automatically be processed in Beaufort.
- [ ] ClientID, ClientSecret and tenantID
  - Since we are using the API we need the ClientID, ClientSecret and tenantID to authenticate with RAET IAM-API Webservice.
- [ ] Dependent account data in HelloID.
  - Please make your provisioned system dependent on this Users Target Connector and make sure that the values needed to be written back are stored on the account data (e.g UserPrincipalName).

### Remarks

> [!TIP]
> This version is created for export only 'rubriekcode' P01035 (emailaddress work).
>
> When the value in Raet equals the value in HelloID, the action will be skipped (no update will take place).
